# Overview

From [*Networks Land*](http://networks.land/activities/i-think-therefore-icann/):
- "Domain names are where the politics, poetics, and peculiarities of the web express themselves in often the most direct and clever ways. But even the most active domain name hoarder might not really understand how the Domain Name System works, why certain TLDs exist, and how they at times become an arena where real-world geopolitical conflicts play out online. This game is meant to walk players through some of those realities."

For our purposes, folks will be working in groups of 6, with pairs assigned to each role:
- Country-code top-level domain (ccTLD)
- General top-level domain (gTLD)
- Secessionist region (seeking a TLD)

Each role needs an envelope with a scoresheet and set of cards. Each group also needs a 6-sided dice. 
- Prof. Walden has dice available, or you can do a quick web search for `random dice roller` (Google web search is a good option here).
- At this point, DO NOT look at your cards.

My recommendation is for one person in each pair to focus on navigating the rules and consulting documentation, while the other coordinates points and focuses on game play.

You're welcome to choose or invent a country and a name/purpose for your domain.

# Goals

Each player should try to have at least 500 points to be able to acquire a TLD, acquire additional TLDs, and/or prevent the loss of your TLD.

# Game Play

## Start

Each player rolls the 6-sided dice and multiplying that value by 100 for your starting point value.

The `cTLD` and `gTLD` players each have 1 TLD when the game starts.

Playing order is determined by the starting point values (highest starting value draws first). 

## Rounds

Each round, `cTLD` and `gTLD` players get a scarcity bonus. This bonus is calculated by rolling the 6-sided dice and multiplying that value by 10.

Whoever is first in the playing order draws one of their cards and follows the instructions.

Once a secessionist region purchases a TLD, they start playing as a `gTLD`.
