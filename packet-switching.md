# Setup

For our purposes, folks will be working in groups of 6:
- `Computer host` (1 person)
- `TCP / IP` (1 person)
- `Routers` (2 people)
- `Packets` (2 people)

Each group needs three envelopes:
- `Packet Switching Infrastructure` (1)
- `Packet Switching Data` (2)

When simulating a packet-switching network....
- The computer host roles are responsible for giving the packets initial instructions and/or interpreting the reconstituted packet
- The TCP / IP roles are responsible for translating or reconstituting the packets once they arrive at a final destination
- The router roles are responsible for directing packets through the network from their source to final destination. 
  * NOTE: Each leg of the network (or `hop`) can only support one packet at a time. If needed, packets can bottleneck and queue.
- The packet roles are responsible for moving packets through the network based on the instructions from the routers. This role can help the TCP/IP role reassemble the packet once all components have arrived at the final destination.  

# Local Area Networks

Once your small group has formed and coordinated roles, link up with another group to form a `local area network` (LAN).

Run through a packet-switching simulation to get your network's packets from a source computer host to a destination computer host.
- NOTE: This is note a race. Work together to try to understand the individual roles as well as how they work together.

Rotate roles and run the simulation a few more times so everyone has a chance to be...
- A computer host or TCP/IP
- A router
- A packet

# Wide Area Networks

Now, we're going to combine all our local area networks (LANs) to make a `wide area network` (WAN).

NOTE- before we reconfigure the network, make sure folks in your group who will be in the packet roles note both computer host I.P. addresses in your original `LAN`.
- This information is written on the outside of your envelope as well as on a sheet of paper.

ANOTHER NOTE- We're adding a disruption packet to this round. This goes to whomever requests it first from Prof. Walden.

How we'll set up for this round:
- Folks in the `computer host` role need to shuffle and arrange themselves on the perimeter of the room.
- Folks in the `TCP/IP` role should be on the perimeter, in front of their computer host.
- Folks in the `Packet` role should regroup at one of their original LAN computer hosts.
- Folks in the `Router` role should spread out throughout the space.

Run through a packet-switching simulation to get your group's packets from a source computer host to a destination computer host.
- NOTE: This is note a race. Work together to try to understand the individual roles as well as how they work together.
- Each group's goal is to transmit your packet to the other computer host in your original LAN

Rotate roles and run the simulation a few more times so everyone has a chance to be...
- A computer host or TCP/IP
- A router
- A packet

# Discussion & Reflection

What did we learn from this
- Bottleneck / lags
- Routing / packet switching
- Physical infrastructure / network volatility
- Other things folks want to share
- Any guesses whatâ€™s on your puzzle
